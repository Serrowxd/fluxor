---

## Implementation Strategy

### Current Status:
✅ **Completed**: All core infrastructure, business domains, and supporting services modules have been implemented.

### Remaining Work:
1. **Advanced Business Features**: 
   - Procurement Domain Module (4-5 days)
   - Audit Module (2-3 days)
   - Rate Limiting Module (2-3 days)

2. **Final Integration**:
   - Update Migration Proxy (2-3 days)

### Recommended Approach:
- Focus on completing the Procurement Domain Module first as it provides significant business value
- Implement Audit and Rate Limiting modules in parallel if resources allow
- Complete the Migration Proxy update to enable full modular architecture deployment

### Success Criteria:
- Each module passes unit tests with >90% coverage
- Integration tests verify inter-module communication
- Performance benchmarks meet SLA requirements
- Documentation is complete for each module
- Migration proxy successfully routes to new modules

## Total Estimated Effort (Remaining Modules Only)

- **High Priority**: ~2-3 days (Migration Proxy Update)
- **Medium Priority**: ~11-14 days (Procurement, Audit, Rate Limiting)
- **Low Priority**: 0 days (All completed)
- **Total**: ~13-17 days

## Notes

1. All estimates assume a single developer. With parallel development, timeline can be significantly reduced.
2. Each module should follow the established patterns from completed modules.
3. Integration testing between modules is critical and should be done continuously.
4. Consider implementing modules that unlock the most business value first.
5. The modular architecture allows for gradual rollout using feature flags.
